      <description>Recently I had to use the box-sizing property&amp;hellip; and every time I needed to search on Internet for the correct usages. So, last time this happened I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a post about it, with the hope this help me memorize it - or at least next time I can google for myself ðŸ™‚
box-sizing, why? Until a few years ago, when you assigned an element a ruleset like the following, you got a square with size 120 pixel.</description>

      <description>Few months ago, I started working with SASS - I use SCSS syntax cause I care about my mental health.
It&amp;rsquo;s not particularly difficult, and if you learnt CSS, well, you could learn SASS.
One of the first thing I wanted was some kind of SASS cheatsheet - so I summarized the main features of SASS in a SASS file.
Variables Sass allows you to declare variables that can be used through the stylesheet.</description>
