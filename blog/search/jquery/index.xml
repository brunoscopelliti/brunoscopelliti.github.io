      <description>Ok, jQuery doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any presentation.
I really like it; it has simplified a lot my work&amp;hellip; BUT sometimes its almost 100Kb of sweetness are a price we can not pay. If this is the case a good trade-off between light weight pages and all the goodness of jQuery, is to use a custom build of jQuery.
Custom builds allow to choose what features of jQuery are to be included in the minified file, and which not; perhaps you are working on a project and you are sure you&amp;rsquo;ll never have to do an asynchronous request?</description>
