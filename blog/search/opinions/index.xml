      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m always been on default export team.
I cannot find the link now - but I remember this being what TC39 recommended at some point.
I kept using almost exclusively default export even after Nicholas Zakas - a person in the tech space I really admire, and respect - wrote his motivation for not using default export anymore.
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been working more with named exports (not my choice, btw) and came to realize that to me it&amp;rsquo;s really not important the export format - both have their own specific pros - as long as the file is not a mess.</description>

Simplify your .reduce calls by doing as much work as possible in .filter and .map instead. Compare these two snippets. Which is more readable? Notice that when map arranges data exactly how we want, our .reduce can be just Object.assign.#typescript #javascript pic.twitter.com/3TW57kaCar
