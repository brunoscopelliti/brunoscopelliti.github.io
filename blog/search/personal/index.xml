      <description>Some months ago, I changed my home working setup.
I changed my middle 2011 iMac with a macbook pro + Apple monitor combo. My old iMac was in great shape, however the new setup is an enhancement because now I&amp;rsquo;ve a bigger monitor, and the freedom to use my mac from everywhere.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also bought the BookArc stand. When at home, I wanted to use the monitor, and keep the macbook with the lid closed.</description>

      <description>I usually wake up early in the morning, before anyone else at my house.
I use this time to maintain this blog, run some side projects, stay updated about latest hot trends in our industry. In general I like to have some time to spend just with myself; then in the evening, when I come from work, I&amp;rsquo;m even more happy to stay with my family, and every device is off by default.</description>

      <description>As someone of you might have noted, recently my blog has changed skin - second time in 2016. I&amp;rsquo;ve also started serving its content over SSL, and migrated the hosting on Digital Ocean&amp;hellip; I think that&amp;rsquo;s a lot that has changed.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to restart writing here on regular basis, and I&amp;rsquo;ve already a list of things I would like to talk about.
Thanks for reading! See you around ðŸ™‚</description>

      <description>Fireworks in Bologna  The year is near its end.
After I postponed it for a long time, in 2013 I finally started blogging, and would like to continue in the future. There are lots of technologies I would like to try, eg. nodejs.
My free time in the next months will suffer a significant cut, and I could not be happier. In February, I will become father. Me and my wife decided to call our first daughter Chiara.</description>

      <description>I am enthusiast to start this blog.
The first post is always the most difficult&amp;hellip; so this is going to be a short one; just to say that here I&amp;rsquo;m going to write about software development.
Recently I started learning AngularJS, and I am really impressed. I finished reading the docs - which are great - and I am going to start my own experiments soon.
A final note Currently this blog is using the Twenty Eleven WordPress theme.</description>
