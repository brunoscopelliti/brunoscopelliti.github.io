      <description>If I have to describe my relationship with TypeScript in one word, I&amp;rsquo;ll say it is complicated.
To put it shortly, I think most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s not worth the additional work, and headaches it causes - especially considering that in my usual setup I&amp;rsquo;ve unit test with high coverage, and meaningful JSDoc annotations.
If you disagree - don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s fine ðŸ™‚
Anyway, in recent years TypeScript has grown in popularity, and always more often I find it in my way.</description>
