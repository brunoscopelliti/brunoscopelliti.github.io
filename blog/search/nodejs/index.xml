I will update this post while continuing advance through the course. Last updated: 25 February 2023.

      <description>A quick search on npmjs reveals how this topic is at the center of JavaScript developer&amp;rsquo;s hearts. I used to have too my personal utility to convert Node.js callback-based internals methods into returning-promise ones.
So I guess this is a big, great news for everyone who&amp;rsquo;s working with node: Node.js is adding a new utility that does just this at its core, util.promisify.
If you have ever used one of those promisify modules, you won&amp;rsquo;t be too much surprised by util.</description>
