      <description>As most people do nowadays, I write code using modern JavaScript&amp;hellip; then serve the transpiled version, also adding the polyfills where needed. It mostly works fine, except when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t ðŸ™ƒ.  In fact, recently we got this bug report:
 When the user clicks the menu button, the menu doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear.
 The problem was easily reproducible on IE11 - and only on IE11.
First guesses One interesting thing about this menu is that its content is fetched asyncronously only after the user clicks on a particular button.</description>

      <description>I am a conservative person.  Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started thinking this is a great quality, especially for a developer.
Of course, I like improvements; the kind of changes I am more prone to make, are those which affect code readability, or bring coherence to the codebase; who have worked with me can confirm how pedantic I am on these kind of things. I change my own code (and blog posts) several times before I push on the repository.</description>
