      <description>I am a conservative person.
Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started thinking this is a great quality, especially for a developer.
Of course, I like improvements; the kind of changes I am more prone to make, are those which affect code readability, or bring coherence to the codebase; who have worked with me can confirm how pedantic I am on these kind of things.
I change my own code (and blog posts) several times before I push on the repository.</description>
